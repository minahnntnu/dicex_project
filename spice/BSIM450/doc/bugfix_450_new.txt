		Title: List of Bugs in BSIM4.5.0 
	=====================================================

  Xuemei (Jane) Xi, Ali M. Niknejad and Chenming Hu


  The following is a list of the bugs and improvements found in BSIM4.5.0 along 
with the bug fixes and improvement which have been evaluated by BSIM team and 
the bug reporters. However, these bugs and fixes are not the finalized ones and 
have to be further evaluated and approved by Compact Model Council (CMC) member 
companies (Please see "CMC's Bug Reporting and Resolution Procedure" attached at 
the bottom of this file). Thus, they should not be included in any commercial 
production releases.

Any new bugs found in BSIM4.5.0 in the future, along with proposed corresponding 
bug fixes, will be added in this file.

The finalized bug fixes approved by CMC member companies will be posted on this 
web site in a separate file under the BSIM4.5.0 section.


Improvement 1:
------
  Reporter: Geoffrey J. Coram, Analog Device
  C files involved: b4noi.c
  parameter LINTNOI not included in flicker noise Swi term and spice2 flicker noise model.

Proposed fix:
  Add it to those terms with:
  use
	Leff = pParam->BSIM4leff - 2.0 * model->BSIM4lintnoi;
  to replace 
	pParam->BSIM4leff 

Bug 1:
------
  Bug reporters: Jean-Paul MALZAC    Silvaco
  C files involved: b4temp.c
  The bug description: DELVTO is not accounted for in Vfbcv.
  
Proposed bug fix:

        1. vbs ====>vbs_jct;
        2. vbd ====>vbd_jct;
        3. (model->BSIM4vtxx - vbs) < 1e-3   ====> (model->BSIM4vtxx - vbs) / model->BSIM4vtxx < 1e-3
        4. Line 916. DEXP(T0, T4, T10) ====>  DEXP(T0, T6, T10)
        
Bug 2:
------
  Bug reporters: Jean-Paul MALZAC    Silvaco
  C files involved: b4check.c, b4set.c

  The bug description: Instance parameter NGCON set to 1.0 before its use in b4temp.c 

Proposed bug fix:

	move following lines from b4check.c to after NGCON default setting in b4set.c :

            if ((here->BSIM4ngcon != 1.0) && (here->BSIM4ngcon != 2.0))
            {   here->BSIM4ngcon = 1.0;
                fprintf(fplog, "Warning: Ngcon must be equal to one or two; reset to 1.0.\n");
                printf("Warning: Ngcon must be equal to one or two; reset to 1.0.\n");
            }

Bug 3:
------
  Bug reporters: Jean-Paul MALZAC    Silvaco
  C files involved: b4.c
  C code containing the bug:

  C code containing the bug:

IOP( "sc",? BSIM4_SCA,???? IF_REAL?? , "Distance to a single well edge "),

Proposed bug fix:

IOP( "sc",? BSIM4_SC,???? IF_REAL?? , "Distance to a single well edge "),


Bug 4:
------
  Bug reporters: Andreas Sunardi, Tektronix Inc.
  C files involved: b4ld.c
  C code containing the bug:
in mobMod == 2:

		  T3 = T0 / model->BSIM4toxe;
              T7 = - 2.0 * T6 / T0;
Proposed bug fix:

		  T3 = T0;
              T7 = - 2.0 * T6 / (T0 * model->BSIM4toxe);





CMC Bug Reporting Procedure for BSIM3/4
1. User reports bug to simulator vendor.
2. Spice provider reports bug to Berkeley with recommended fix, test case and significance.
3. Berkeley will immediately post on the website with the recommended fix.
4. Berkeley will notify CMC, BSIM3/4 mailing list and FSA
5. CMC members review bug and proposed fixes
6. At the next CMC meeting the CMC will decide on what action to take on each bug. A revision
number (e.g. 3.2.1) will be assigned to the code with the accepted bug fixes.
7. Berkeley will post the list of approved bug fixes on the website along with the revision 
number assigned. Where appropriate this may include sections of revised code but Berkeley 
will not post a complete new release of the code for each minor version. For example v3.2.1 
might be specified as equivalent to v3.2 with the bug fixes posted on a particular Web page.
